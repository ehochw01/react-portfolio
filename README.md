## Description
```
This is my professional programming portfolio. It was built using React.js and CSS. I purposely avoided Bootstrap and other CSS frameworks for this in order to get some practice with raw CSS. It contains an About page, a Projects page with a list of Projects and links to see them, a Contact Page, and a Resume page.
